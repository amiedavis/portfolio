    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Isnâ€™t that a great question, and one I think we should all ask ourselves on a regular basis. ðŸ˜‰ <br><br>
        I am a partner, aunty, lover of pottery and poetry, keen amateur futsal player and Matildas supporter.<br><br>
        I also like to design and write software, as I first discovered whilst in the second year of my Engineering degree (but I went on and majored in mechatronics anyway - microprocessors are fun!).<br><br>
        Since graduating I have built up a combined total of 7 years experience working as a full-stack engineer.

    <h2>Work with me</h2>

    <p>
        Right now Iâ€™m working on building up my portfolio, since most of my work life so far has consisted of contributing to proprietary software. This means that I'm working at a reduced rate - so if you have a tight budget, now might be the best time to get in touch!<br><br>
        Whether youâ€™re looking for someone to build you an application, website, or think there might be a way to automate something youâ€™re sick of doing manually, Iâ€™d be happy to chat!
